Unit 05 Instructions

The goal is to show the Y coordinate of the cube on the screen. 
You will need to add some extra code to the "ChangeTextValue.cs" 
Component on the Text (TMP) GameObject. 
You will probably need to make edits in the Inspector as well 
(but nothing needs to be added to the Inspector).
